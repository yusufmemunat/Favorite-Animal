    <h2>Good day Everyone</h2>
    <p>My name is Memunat.
    <p>I am here to present to you on the topic "My favourite Animal"</p>
    <p>My favourite animal is a Dog.</p>
    <p>A Dog is a four-legged mammal.</p>
    <p>The sound it makes is a barking sound.
    <p>Dogs comes in different colors, feature, behavioural ways and also comes from different</p> countries just the
    same way human also comes from different continents, country and also has <p>different features and look to
        differentiate us from one another.</p>
    <p>Dogs have different purposes and are trained or brought up differently in accordance to the purpose they are to
        serve.</p>
    <p>For example a germany dog will be different from how a bull dog will be trained and brought up </p>
    <p>The young one or a child of a dog is called "Puppy".</p>
    <p>Puppies are generally always very playful with a happy atmosphere around them.</p>
    <p>Dogs are considered human best friend and are the closest animal to humans majorly due to the fact that are
        usually a nice and loyal companions to have excluding humans. </p>
    <p>I like dogs because no matter how they are trained and treated they are still capable of beign loyal and
        endearing to humans.</p>
